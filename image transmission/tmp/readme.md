First, download the coco dataset in this [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-1EzJlLTCIY9xfvlmXgGIX8LPurEaby7?usp=sharing) into the tmp/
It should be like tmp/coco/2014/1.1.0/xxtfrecordxx

These tfrecords are generated by tensorflow_datasets (tfds) 4.6.0, so if the tfds version is the same, you can directly use them. If u choose to generate by yourselves, it may take one day to unzip


Then, download the trained models for the adaptive-length method
