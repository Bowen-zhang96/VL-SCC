## VL-SCC
This is the official code for the experiments in 'Semantic Communications with Variable-Length Coding for Extended Reality'. [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10198383)

I am gradually uploading the code for this paper now :).


## Acknowledge
The human mesh recovery experiment is developed based on this [project](https://github.com/russoale/hmr2.0)
